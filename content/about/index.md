I am a computational quantum physics student at [Polytechnique](https://polytechnique.edu/) (France).

My goal is to study computational methods to improve the understanding of quantum matter. I am also interested by quantum computers, and especially how they relate to computational physics.

Aside from that, I love playing volleyball, partying and taking photos.

My resume can be found [here](/resume.pdf).
